# Forge Public Safety Marketing Site

Standalone marketing website for **forgepublicsafety.com**, rebuilt outside GoDaddy Airo.

## What's included

- Home, Products, Solutions, Resources, Company, Contact
- Privacy, Terms, Security
- **No pricing page** — `/pricing` redirects to `/contact`
- Links to live RMS at `https://rms.forgepublicsafety.com`

## Local development

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\jerem\OneDrive\Axis Public Safety RMS\forgepublicsafety-website"
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```powershell
npm run build
```

## Deploy to Firebase Hosting

This project is configured for Firebase project `rms-dashboard-7562e`.

```powershell
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting:marketing
```

Until DNS is switched, preview the site at **https://forgepublicsafety-com.web.app** and the CMS at **https://forgepublicsafety-com.web.app/admin**.

### Point forgepublicsafety.com to Firebase

The marketing site is deployed to Firebase site **`forgepublicsafety-com`** (not the RMS app).

1. Firebase Console → **Hosting** → site **forgepublicsafety-com** → **Add custom domain** → `forgepublicsafety.com`
2. In GoDaddy: disconnect the domain from **Airo Builder** first
3. Add the DNS records Firebase shows (usually A records + TXT for verification)
4. Wait for SSL (can take up to 24 hours)

Until DNS switches, use **https://forgepublicsafety-com.web.app** and **https://forgepublicsafety-com.web.app/admin**.

## Demo form

The contact form opens a `mailto:demo@forgepublicsafety.com` message. Replace with Formspree, Firebase Functions, or another form backend when ready.

## Content editor (Decap CMS)

Browser-based editing at **`/admin`**. See **`DECAP-CMS-SETUP.md`** for one-time GitHub + OAuth setup, then **`EDITING.md`** for day-to-day use.

## Assets

Logo and hero image were copied from the live Airo site into `public/assets/`.
